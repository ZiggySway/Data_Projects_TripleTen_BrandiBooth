# Explatory Data Analysis - EDA

### The company name is Instacart

In this project I take data from Instacart, where groceries are ordered online then delivered.  I want to determine Instacart customer habits. 

In this project I will use basic python skills, along with cleaning data, and explatory data analysis.  I will work with 5 different dataframes in this project and will have to concatenate some dataframes to get some analysis resutls.


 
### Details of EDA

I will prepare the data and make reports that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. I will answer the questions with code and, write a brief explanation of your results in a markdown cells of Jupyter notebook.  I will also make plots to visualize the data, communicating my results.  I found the first 20 product_id 's using value counts method.  Then I created a merge_df variable. and produced merging code of df's: products_df and order_products_df.  Then filtered out the top 20 using value_counts and sorting


#### The Data

Data is taken from Kaggle.com, this dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. The dataset has been modified from the original. 


### Results

From analyzing customer habits I have inferred that Sunday, then followed by Monday are the top days that people shop for groceries.  So Sunday is the day people mostly shop for groceries.  Also, that the minimun amount of time people wait before placing next order is 0 days and the maximum amount of recorded time that people wait is 30 days. On average, people wait 7 days or 30 days before placing there next order. Wednesday and Saturday have similarities.  10am and 3pm (15:00 hrs) on Wednesday are the peak purchase hours.  Saturday's peak hours are approximately 2pm (14:00 hours). Most customers ordered less than 20 items.  The bulk being between 1 and 5 items.
