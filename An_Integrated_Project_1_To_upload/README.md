# An Integrated Project 1 - Statistical Analysis, Forecasting

### The company name is Online Video Game Distributor, Ice

This project is a competition analysis and statistical work for an online video gaming store that has world wide reach.   Here I infer useful information for game make production and selling expectations.  My job is to identify patterns that determines whether a game succeeds or not.  With this information I will infer big winners and help advise the marketing team for advertising campaigns.  I am helping to forecast 2017 sales. 

 
### Details of Statistical Analysis and Forecasting

Cleaned and preprocessed data. Calculated the total sales in all the regions and feature engineered a new column. Created a histogram to visualize game distribution over the years. Created a sellers profile for each region; showcasing what sells best where. 

#### The Data

I have historical game data from open sources to utilize for my company. The data is from 1980 to 2016, and the company is planning a launch for 2017.  

### Results

We see how sales vary from platform to platform. PS2 sales lead and X360 follows, with PS3 closely behind. We can see the distribution of the top 10 platforms and the years of their sales.  PS2 had high sales over an extended period of time, and was the top seller.  The analysis shows that platforms have the tendency to go out of popularity on average of 7.5 years after initial release.  Action and shooter games are the highest selling genres.  I come to the conclusion I cannot reject the Null Hypothesis.  Null hypthothesis: The average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.  And secondly, I do reject the null hypothesis.  Null hypthothesis: The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are not different.
