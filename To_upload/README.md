# Telecom Operator - Forecasting

### The company name is Interconnect

This project was a team effort; with a team leader assigning tasks to meet the company's request.  The company, Interconnect, had a goal to determine the churn of their clients; determining which clients would be leaving their services.  The business value of this forecasting allows the business to get ahead of that decision and offer loyalty perks such as special plan options and promotional codes to ensure the customers' loyalties.  
 
### Details of Forecasting project

The project was taken into parts, to preprocess the data; in cleaning the data for best results, and prepare a data analysis report displaying valuable insights, usable for business results.  Next we were to compute the data for Machine learning purposes; encoding the data and preparing numbers within the data for machine learning use.  Using the correct framework to determine the categorical outcomes for the mission of the project.  I used visualization for reports; and hypertunning with metrics for accuracy of model deployment. 

### Colleagues

- Team Lead: Assigned tasks and reviews progress on models to meet requirements and to ensure a timely deployment.
- Quality Assurance: Independent expert from QA department that works in machine learning. Reviewed code to assure its quality and readiness for deployment. 

#### The Data

The data is a modified version from Kaggle.


### Results

In thorough examination during the EDA, I found imbalanced data.  The data was balanced using scaler with pipelines.  Predictive models were built with tests of accuracy included.  The final model of the binary classification test passed the accuracy; which was visualized using the AUC-ROC plot, and solidified predictive forecasting.
