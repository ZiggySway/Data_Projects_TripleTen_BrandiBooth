# Numerical Methods - Using Data for Predicting

### The company name is Rusty Bargain Used Cars

We need to build a model to quickly determine the value of cars added to the app.
Rusty Bargain is interested in the quality/accuracy of the prediction, the speed of the prediction, and the time required for training the model that predicts. 
. 
 
### Details of Numerical Methods

I have access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices.  Initially I cleaned the data; and performed an EDA (Explotary Data Analysis).  I used label encoder to create a encoding for the categorical features; in preparation of building the ML model. I wrote pipelines for model and gradient boosting analysis on test set using hyper parameters; for LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor and CatBoostRegressor.


#### The Data

The data was combed and presented.  Real car facts gathered and processed.    


### Results

I build a model that predicts price with accurate efficiency.  The dummy model happened to be the fastest.  But since we need accuracy; RFR and Catboost provide higher accuracy.  Considering speed and accuracy RFR is a good model to perform the cost analysis.  <b>(Predictive models, computational run time)
