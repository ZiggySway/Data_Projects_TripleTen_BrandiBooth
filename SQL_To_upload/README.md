# SQL - Advanced

### The company name is Zuber

For this project I examine Taxi companies. I identify the top 10 neighborhoods for rides.  I also test a hypothesis.  The null hypothesis: The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays.

 
### Details of SQL.  

I analyze the conclusions of my details. Here I also experiment with imports such as: from pyspark.sql import SparkSession; Utilizing SQL with PySpark. 
I use an internal platform similar to PostgreSQL; building dataframes and requesting searches using: FROM, SELECT, CASE, WHEN, END AS, INNER JOIN, OUTTER JOIN, and more.  I test the hypothesis in python using a ttest, with p_value. 

#### The Data

I parse the data from the internet using a request.get function and Using BeautifulSoup to integrate the data.  For this project, I integrate the weather from valuable outside source (The weather channel) with all of it's accuracy to JSON pull the data and make it extractable for usage.     


### Results

Through Explotary Data Analysis, it is shown which company has the greatest ride share, market share. I used visualizations to display the top 20 companies, which Flash Cab being the largest market share holder. I also use visualization to show the largest drop off neighborhood, which is Loop.  I come to the conclusion to Reject the null hypothesis: The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays.
