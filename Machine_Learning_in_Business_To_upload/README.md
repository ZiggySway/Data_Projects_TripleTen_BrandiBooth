# Machine Learning in Business - Automation of New business locations

### The company name is Oily Giant

Working for the OilyGiant mining company I will help them to find the best place for a new well.  I will collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves; and build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells.  This will help determine the predictability for best profit growth building new wells.   

### Details of Automation of New business locations 

After cleaning and analyzing data.  I built a function to calculate profit from the best 200 wells.  Also calculated the risks from each region; built a function to generate expected profit losses for further estimations.  I used bootstrapping to generate a vector of how much profit can be generated based on smaller random subsets.

#### The Data

The data was presented through historical efforts of the company.      

### Results

Upon results showing a normal distribution is build confidence for success to build in specific areas and can churn out consistent profits.  For Profit Calculations, the estimate is on the safe investment with a barrel count of $111.11 thousands of oil barrels, And we have two regions that are close in all metrics so having this value.  The function calculates the profit for the best 200 wells, based from our prediction model.  I recommend the company to start to dig the first 200 wells in region II for best profitability.
