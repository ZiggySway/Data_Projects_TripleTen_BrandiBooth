# Software Development Tools - Command Line, Streamlit, Git, Github, Jupyter notebooks

### Agenda

Here I learn the tools to work with teammates. I learn and utilize Command line in OS prompt, Anaconda prompt, and inside an IDE prompt.  This project aims to provide myself with additional practice on common software engineering tasks. These tasks will augment and complement my own data skills. Here I develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public.
 
### Details of Software Development tools

I built a project that helps myself and others understand more or less some of the benefits of this community and building tools to help others.  

This code shows and tells people what they can expect for data scientist
salaries based on the experience level of the worker. 

If a person wants to utilize this code; they can fork the code in github and perform further analysis on the data.



#### The Data

The original data is on my own github under respository; salaries.  
And has a display of usage on a website built using streamlit at 
https://salaries.onrender.com/

### Results

My personal github got created. I created a repository; utilized plotly.express, streamlit, render.com and more. I also created an EDA in Jupyter notebooks, and 
concluded Less than 200 of the observed surveyors work hybrid positions of 50% remote-work. Just slightly more of the data scientist field workers work fully remote jobs. And the other majority workers, work fully in office/ on site.
