# Machine Learning for Text - LLM, BERT

### The company name is Film Junky Union

The goal here is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts.  The mission is to develope a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. 
 
### Details of Large Language model

Used frameworks of scikit-learn, regular expression; label encoder for preprocessing prep; NLTK to tokenize the language, Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency, to determine frequency relevancy.  And also BERT and spaCy. 


#### The Data

Used a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. 


### Results

I built a model to determine the difference between positive and negative reviews.  Determined the model will need to have an F1 score of at least 0.85 for accuracy.  The model slightly struggled with sarcasm; but so do humans!
