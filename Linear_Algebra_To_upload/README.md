# Linear Algebra - Data Obfuscation

### The company name is Sure Tommorrow Insurance 

Here I prove that Machine learning can benefit this insurance company and I make goals and target areas to obtain insight. I group clients together that show similarity for the marketing department.  I Build models to predict if a new client is likely to receive a claim and if so how many. This helps determine profability per client and make quotas. Lastly to insure the clients data is kept private for no damage in privacy breaches.  

 
### Details of Linear Algebra

After cleaning and EDA; to calculate clients who are similar I use distance vectors; Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance, determining the best results. 
I scaled and unscaled data noting any changes.  I develop a data transformation algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information if the data fell into the wrong hands.  I do this by using a multiplied matrix of the data. 


#### The Data

The data was presented through the company.      


### Results

Similarities in customers can be found via automation of Machine learning.  Predictions of who may file claims can be done with a level of accuracy.  And Data obfuscation can be achieved to protect customers and company brand.
