# Computer Vision- TensorFlow

### The company name GoodSeed Supermarket

This project helps a supermarket chain in exploring whether Data Science can help adhere to alcohol laws by making sure the supermarket does not sell alcohol to people underage.  

## Initialization 
 
### Details of Computervision project

A brief EDA was conducting with visualization.  The main framework used was tensorflow, keras.  I used ImageDataGenerator, to set up the process. Created a loop to set up batches of the images.  Used ReLu activation, MSE for the loss function and MAE for the accuracy metrics.  Created functions to load and run the models.   


#### The Data

For this project; a dataset of faces were used.  


### Results

This regression task, trained on faces to know a person's age. The technology can be used to make accurate predictions.
